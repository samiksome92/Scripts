# A Collection of Small Scripts

This is simply a collection of scripts to make my life easier.

## JavaScript Scripts

- [`nyaaMagnet.js`](#nyaaMagnetjs)
- [`twitterImage.js`](#twitterImagejs)

## Python Scripts

- [`nocache.http.server.py`](#nocachehttpserverpy)

## `nocache.http.server.py`

A script implementing a simple http server with custom cache control headers. Usage is same as http.server.

## `nyaaMagnet.js`

This script adds an extra button beside the search button in [nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si), which collects magnet links for all of the torrents listed in the current page/screen and copies them to the clipboard.

Primary use is searching for torrents of a series and grabbing all magnet links (say for all episodes) in one go.

## `twitterImage.js`

A script to redirect image urls from twitter to show the original image rather than one of the twitter resized versions. Simply replaces the last part of image urls with `=orig`.
